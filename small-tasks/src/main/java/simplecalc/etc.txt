degree of difficulty: 1

Implement a simple calculator which evaluates arithmetic expressions given as a String. The expression should only consists of numbers 0 to 9, parenthesis, and the binary and unary operators + and -. White spaces are ignored. Implement a recursive descent parser for reading in the String.

The syntax is given as the following EBNF:

expression = term, [ "+" | "-" , term ] ;
term     = "(",  term, ")"
            | "0" | "1" | ... | "9" ;
The follwing strings are valid: "1", "((2))", "2 + 3", "( (4) - 5 +7)".
